# typed-log4js

`log4js` typing for node.js, as the orginal files are not 100% compatible, please reference to the projects:

- https://github.com/nomiddlename/log4js-node
- http://github.com/armorik83

This is a test project. Please do not use this repo as it can be droped any time.

The goal of the project is to check the procedure to host @github own typing files.
